Short description for links above
---
First link:
- map is used to transform the rounds array into an array of differentials by calculating the player's adjusted score based on the course rating and slope rating for each round.

Second link: 
- reduce is used to accumulate the total score from all rounds by summing the score from each round in the rounds array.

Description of research topics above with points
---
- (6 points) React
  - React is used as the main frontend framework to build the golf stats management system. It manages the user interface and facilitates interactivity, creating a dynamic and responsive experience for users.
- (5 points) JSON Web Tokens, JWT
  - JWT is implemented for user authentication. The tokens enable secure login, round saving, and user profile management, ensuring that only authenticated users can access and modify their data. 
- (2 points) Tailwind CSS
  - Tailwind CSS is used to style the application, providing a utility-first approach for creating responsive and modern designs. This speeds up development by applying styles directly in JSX without the need for custom CSS files.
- (2 points) Client-Side Javascript Library: React Hook Form
  - React Hook Form is utilized to manage form state and validation. It simplifies handling forms for adding new rounds and updating stats, ensuring smooth user interaction and efficient input validation.

React, JWT Tokens, and Tailwind CSS is used throughout my entire application but I included one example for each. 

- **React code found in Home.jsx**: [https://github.com/nyu-csci-ua-0467-001-002-fall-2024/final-project-mkphung29/blob/master/src/client/src/pages/Home.jsx]
- **JWT Tokens is implemented in app.mjs. Link to middleware for JWT in lines 81-98**: [https://github.com/nyu-csci-ua-0467-001-002-fall-2024/final-project-mkphung29/blob/master/src/app.mjs]
- **Tailwind CSS in Home.jsx**: [https://github.com/nyu-csci-ua-0467-001-002-fall-2024/final-project-mkphung29/blob/master/src/client/src/pages/Home.jsx]
- **React Hook Form found in AddRound.jsx, Login.jsx, Signup.jsx, and Prediction.jsx**: 
    - AddRound.jsx: [https://github.com/nyu-csci-ua-0467-001-002-fall-2024/final-project-mkphung29/blob/master/src/client/src/pages/AddRound.jsx]

Optional project notes 
--- 
Use this sample username and login to see the handicap, scoring average, and pesonal best statistics. This user will already have rounds saved in order to calculate these stats, so the grader doesn't have to input info themselves.

username: golfer11
password: 123
